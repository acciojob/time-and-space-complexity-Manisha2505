	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is the number of operations needed to run an algorithm on large amounts of data. And the number of operations can be considered as time because the computer uses some time for each operation. There are basic complexity metrics of the efficiency of an algorithm:
		Time complexity is a function that describes how long an algorithm takes in terms of the quantity of input it receives.
	</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> in data structures is the amount of memory an algorithm needs to solve a problem, as a function of the input size. It includes the memory used for input values, as well as any additional memory used during execution
	The O(n) algorithm must do n operations in an array with n values to find the lowest value, because the algorithm must compare each value one time.</p>
